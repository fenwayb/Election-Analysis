  Election Analysis

  # Overview
  
  <p>For this project we were tasked with creating a python script which would calculate the outcome of election results for a local government election counters.</p>
  
  ## Results

  <p>The printout from the code shows that:</p> 
***
  * There were 369,711 total voters
  * 38,855(10.5%) of those votes were from Jefferson County, 306,055(82.8%) votes were from Denver County, and 24,801(6.7%) votes were from Arapahoe County
  * The largest county voter turnout was Denver County
  * Charles Casper Stockham had 85,213(23.0%) votes, Diana DeGette 272,892(73.8%) votes, and Raymon Anthony Doane had 11,606(3.1%) votes
  * Diana DeGette won the election with 73.8% of the vote or 272,892 votes
  
    
  # Summary
  <p>This script drastically simplifed the process of summing the results from various sources into an output that is easy to read to determine election outcomes.     Additional functionality that might be useful to add in the future is adding a user interface making it easy to use for even unexperienced workers. This could be further modified by having it turn the data into a pie chart or some other visual representation
